The Webhook integration enables you to send JSON payloads to a specific URL whenever an incident event occurs. This is useful for building custom integrations or connecting to services not natively supported.

## Configuration

To set up a webhook, you need to provide the following details:

| Field | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URL | The endpoint URL where the POST request will be sent. | Yes |
| Secret | A secret key sent in the `X-Webhook-Secret` header for verification. | No |

<Steps>
