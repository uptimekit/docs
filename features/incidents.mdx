UptimeKit provides a comprehensive incident management system to help you communicate service disruptions, maintenance windows, and resolutions to your users effectively.

## Overview

Incidents are events that affect service availability or performance. UptimeKit allows you to:

- Create incidents manually through the dashboard
- Update incidents with status changes and comments
- Resolve incidents when services are restored
- Automatically create incidents via integrations

Incidents are displayed on your status pages, keeping users informed about ongoing issues and their resolution progress.

## Incident Lifecycle

Incidents in UptimeKit follow a structured lifecycle with distinct states:

| State | Description | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Investigating** | Initial state when an issue is first identified | Service is down and the team is determining the root cause |
| **Acknowledged** | Issue has been confirmed and is being worked on | Problem identified, team actively working on a solution |
| **Monitoring** | Fix has been applied and is being monitored | Solution deployed, watching for stability before full resolution |
| **Resolved** | Issue has been completely resolved | Service fully restored and stable |

### State Transitions

A typical incident flow might look like:

1. **Investigating** → Team becomes aware of an issue
2. **Acknowledged** → Root cause identified, fix in progress
3. **Monitoring** → Fix deployed, monitoring for stability
4. **Resolved** → Service confirmed stable, incident closed

<Info>
  You can move between states as needed. For example, if an issue recurs during the Monitoring phase, you can move back to Acknowledged or Investigating.
</Info>

## Creating Incidents Manually

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Incidents">
    Go to the **Incidents** section in your dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Incident">
    Click **Create Incident** and provide:
    - **Title**: A clear, concise description of the issue
    - **Description**: Detailed information about the problem and its impact
    - **Status**: Initial state (typically "Investigating")
    - **Affected Monitors**: Select which monitors are impacted
    - **Severity**: Critical, Major, or Minor
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish">
    Click **Create** to publish the incident to your status page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Severity Levels

Choose the appropriate severity level for each incident:

- **Critical**: Complete service outage, all users affected
- **Major**: Significant degradation, most users affected
- **Minor**: Partial degradation, limited user impact

## Updating Incidents

As you work to resolve an issue, keep users informed by updating the incident.

### Adding Updates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Incident">
    Navigate to the incident you want to update.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Comment">
    In the **Updates** section, add a new comment describing:
    - Current progress
    - Actions being taken
    - Expected timeline (if known)
    - Any workarounds available
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Status">
    If the incident state has changed, update the status to reflect the current situation (e.g., from "Investigating" to "Acknowledged").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Update">
    Click **Add Update** to publish the information to your status page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices for Updates

- Provide regular updates even if there's no significant progress
- Be transparent about the situation and timeline
- Include specific details about actions being taken
- Update the status as soon as the situation changes
- Communicate clearly and avoid technical jargon when possible

<Info>
  Frequent communication during incidents builds trust with your users, even when you don't have a solution yet.
</Info>

## Resolving Incidents

When the issue is fully resolved and service is stable:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Final Update">
    Provide a final update explaining:
    - What was resolved
    - How it was fixed
    - Any preventive measures taken
    - Expected stability going forward
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Status to Resolved">
    Update the incident status to "Resolved".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Post-Resolution">
    Keep an eye on the affected services for a period after resolution to ensure stability.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Resolution Best Practices

- Summarize the incident and its impact
- Explain the root cause (if appropriate)
- Describe the fix that was applied
- Mention any steps taken to prevent recurrence
- Thank users for their patience

## Automatic Incident Creation

UptimeKit can automatically create incidents based on alerts from integrated systems. This is particularly useful for automating your incident response workflow.

### Supported Integrations

The following integrations support automatic incident creation:

- **Prometheus AlertManager**: Creates incidents when alerts fire, automatically resolves when alerts clear
- **Custom Webhooks**: Send POST requests to create incidents programmatically
- **Future Integrations**: Additional integrations may support this feature

### How It Works

1. An external system (e.g., Prometheus) detects an issue
2. The system sends an alert to UptimeKit via the configured integration
3. UptimeKit automatically creates a new incident with relevant details
4. The incident appears on your status page immediately
5. When the alert clears, UptimeKit can automatically resolve the incident (if configured)

<Info>
  Automatic incident creation requires configuring integrations in **Settings** > **Integrations**. See the [Integrations](/integrations) section for setup guides.
</Info>

### Benefits of Automation

- **Faster Response**: Incidents are created immediately when issues occur
- **Reduced Manual Work**: No need to manually create incidents for every alert
- **Consistency**: Automated incidents follow a standardized format
- **24/7 Coverage**: Incidents are created even outside business hours
- **Better User Experience**: Users are notified promptly about issues

## Integration Examples

### Prometheus AlertManager

Configure Prometheus to automatically create incidents when alerts fire. The integration supports:

- Alert deduplication via fingerprints
- Severity mapping from alert labels
- Automatic resolution when alerts clear
- Customizable incident titles using templates

See the [Prometheus AlertManager integration guide](/integrations/prometheus) for detailed setup instructions.

### Custom Webhooks

Send HTTP POST requests to the webhook integration endpoint to create incidents programmatically. This is useful for:

- Custom monitoring systems
- Third-party services
- Scheduled maintenance notifications
- Manual API integrations

See the [Webhook integration guide](/integrations/webhook) for payload format and examples.

## Incident Visibility

Incidents are automatically displayed on your status pages according to their state:

- **Active Incidents** (Investigating, Acknowledged, Monitoring): Shown prominently at the top of the status page
- **Resolved Incidents**: Moved to the incident history section
- **Affected Monitors**: Clearly indicated on the status page

Users can view the full incident timeline, including all updates and status changes, by clicking on an incident.

## Best Practices

### Communication

- **Be Proactive**: Create incidents as soon as you're aware of an issue
- **Update Regularly**: Provide updates every 15-30 minutes during active incidents
- **Be Transparent**: Explain what happened and what you're doing about it
- **Close the Loop**: Always add a final update when resolving

### Organization

- **Use Clear Titles**: Make it immediately obvious what the issue is
- **Tag Affected Monitors**: Help users understand which services are impacted
- **Choose Appropriate Severity**: Accurately reflect the incident's impact
- **Keep History**: Resolved incidents serve as a historical record

### Automation

- **Configure Integrations**: Set up automatic incident creation for faster response
- **Test Your Workflow**: Verify that automated incidents are created correctly
- **Monitor Notifications**: Ensure your team is alerted when incidents are created
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review incident patterns to identify systemic issues

<Warning>
  Always verify that resolved incidents reflect actual service restoration. Prematurely resolving incidents can erode user trust.
</Warning>
