UptimeKit allows you to create beautiful, customizable status pages to keep your users informed about service status. This guide covers advanced status page configuration including custom domains, slug-based routing, and password protection.

## Custom Domain Configuration

You can host your status pages on a custom domain by configuring the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATUS_PAGE_DOMAIN` environment variable.

### Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Environment Variable">
    Add the following to your `.env` file:

    ```ini
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STATUS_PAGE_DOMAIN=status.example.com
    ```

    Replace `status.example.com` with your desired status page domain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Point your custom domain to your UptimeKit installation:

    - Add an A record pointing to your server's IP address, or
    - Add a CNAME record pointing to your UptimeKit domain
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Application">
    Restart your UptimeKit instance to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If you don't configure a custom domain, status pages will be accessible via the default dashboard domain.
</Info>

## Slug-Based Routing

Each status page can have a unique slug that makes it accessible via a clean URL path.

### How It Works

When you create or edit a status page, you can set a custom slug in the status page settings. The slug will be used in the URL:

```
https://status.example.com/your-slug
```

### Best Practices

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Keep slugs short and memorable
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `api`, `website`, `services`)
- Avoid special characters or spaces

<Info>
  Slugs must be unique across all status pages in your UptimeKit instance.
</Info>

## Password Protection

You can make status pages private by enabling password protection. This is useful for internal status pages or pages with sensitive information.

### Enabling Password Protection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Secret Key (Optional)">
    Optionally add a dedicated secret for status page access tokens to your `.env` file:

    ```ini
    STATUS_PAGE_ACCESS_SECRET=your_secure_secret_here
    ```

    <Info>
      This environment variable is **optional**. If not set, UptimeKit will use `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` as a fallback. The secret is used to sign session tokens, not for the actual status page passwords (those are set per-page in the dashboard).
    </Info>

    <Info>
      To generate a secure secret:

      ```bash
      openssl rand -base64 32
      ```
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Protection in Dashboard">
    1. Navigate to your status page settings
    2. Toggle the "Make private" option
    3. Set a password for the status page
    4. Save your changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Protected Page">
    When users visit your status page, they'll be prompted to enter the password. After successful authentication, they'll have access for 24 hours via a secure session token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Security Features

Password-protected status pages include several security features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Argon2id Hashing | Passwords are hashed using Argon2id, a modern password hashing algorithm resistant to GPU and side-channel attacks |
| Session Tokens | Users receive a 24-hour session token after successful authentication |
| Rate Limiting | Built-in protection against brute-force attacks |
| Secure Storage | Passwords are never stored in plain text |

<Warning>
  Always use strong, unique passwords for protected status pages. Either `STATUS_PAGE_ACCESS_SECRET` or `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` must be configured for password protection to work.
</Warning>

### User Authentication Flow

1. User visits the protected status page URL
2. UptimeKit displays a password prompt
3. User enters the status page password
4. Password is verified against the Argon2id hash
5. Upon success, a secure session token is issued for 24 hours
6. User can access the status page without re-authentication during the session period

## Example Configuration

Here's a complete example of status page configuration in your `.env` file:

```ini
# Status Page Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STATUS_PAGE_DOMAIN=status.uptimekit.com
STATUS_PAGE_ACCESS_SECRET=dGhpcyBpcyBhIHZlcnkgc2VjdXJlIHNlY3JldCBrZXk=  # Optional, falls back to BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

# Dashboard Configuration
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=change_me_to_a_secure_secret  # Also used as fallback for STATUS_PAGE_ACCESS_SECRET
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

<Info>
  Remember to restart your UptimeKit instance after making changes to environment variables.
