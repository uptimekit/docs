To connect a worker instance to your UptimeKit dashboard, you need to first create a worker identity in the admin panel and generate an API key. This key secures the communication between your worker and the dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workers Page">
    Navigate to the **Workers** page in the Admin Dashboard and click the **Add Worker** button located at the top right of the table.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Worker">
    In the dialog that appears, fill in the details for your new worker:
    
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your worker (e.g., "US East Node").
    - **Location**: Select the geographical region where your worker is hosted (e.g., "North America", "Europe"). This helps in identifying the source of monitoring requests and providing accurate latency data.

    Click the **Create Worker** button to confirm.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save API Key">
    Once the worker is successfully created, a confirmation dialog will appear displaying your new API Key.

    <Warning>
      **Important:** This API key is only shown once. Make sure to copy it immediately and store it securely. If you lose it, you will need to regenerate a new key, which requires updating your worker's configuration.
    </Warning>

    1. Click the **Copy** icon next to the API key field to copy it to your clipboard.
    2. Store this key safely. You will need to set it as the `WORKER_API_KEY` environment variable when running your worker instance.
    3. Click **Done** to close the dialog.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

With the API Key generated, you are ready to launch your worker.
